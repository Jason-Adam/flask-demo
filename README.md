# ResNet-50 Model Deployed to API Endpoint  
This repo contains everything needed to deploy a pre-trained ResNet-50 CNN as an API endpoint utilizing Flask, Gunicorn, Nginx, and Docker.  

## ResNet-50
ResNet-50 refers to a 50 layer residual neural network that is commonly used to classify images. ResNet-50 was trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet databaseand can classify images into 1000 object categories. The use of a wide array of images resulted in rich feature representations that can be applied to very broadly. adsfadsfasdfasdf
